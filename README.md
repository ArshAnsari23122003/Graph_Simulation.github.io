# Graph_Simulation
An interactive graph visualization tool that demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms on a grid-based map. Users can set start and end points, place obstacles, and observe how different algorithms navigate the grid.

📌 Features

Visualize various pathfinding algorithms in real-time.

Set start and end points dynamically.

Place obstacles to create custom mazes.

Interactive and responsive UI.

🖥️ Available Algorithms

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Dijkstra's Algorithm

A Algorithm (Euclidean & Manhattan heuristics)*

Greedy Best-First Search (Euclidean & Manhattan heuristics)


📖 How to Use

Set Start and End Points

Click on the Start Tile button and then select a tile on the grid.

Click on the End Tile button and choose a tile for the destination.

Place Walls (Obstacles)

Select the Wall Tile button and click or drag on tiles to add barriers.

Run an Algorithm

Click on an algorithm button to visualize the pathfinding process.


🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend.

Canvas API for drawing the grid and animations.

Algorithms implemented in JavaScript for real-time execution.
